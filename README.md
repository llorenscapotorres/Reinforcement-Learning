# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository will contain a collection of implementations of core reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal is to build a comprehensive and educational resource that closely follows fundamental principles of RL, with a focus on clarity and correctness.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Implement foundational reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch.
- Emphasize simplicity, modularity, and readability.
- Enable easy experimentation and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Algorithms Implemented

The repository will grow to include:

- Multi-armed Bandits (e.g., Îµ-greedy, UCB, Gradient Bandits)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration)
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Temporal Difference Learning (TD(0), SARSA, Q-learning)
- Eligibility Traces (TD(Î»), SARSA(Î»))
- Approximate Solutions (Linear function approximation, Tile coding)
- Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic)
- More to come...

## ðŸ§  Learning Focus

This repository is designed for learning and experimentation. It may not prioritize performance or advanced engineering practices, but instead aims to faithfully implement and explain each algorithm step by step.
